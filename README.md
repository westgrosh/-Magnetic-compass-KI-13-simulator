# Magnetic compass simulator 

This project was done at the end of my eduction process in MAI (Moscow Aviation Institute) by myself.

Purpose:
Development of a prototype of a new type of backup navigation device simulator.

Tasks:
1. Develop a prototype of a device that simulates the errors of the KI-13 magnetic compass for functional tests on a flight stand.
2. Develop technical requirements for the prototype "Simulator of the magnetic compass KI-13 for aerobatic stand".
3. Develop a structural and functional diagram of the prototype. Carry out simulation.
4. Develop an algorithm for executing the software part and the program code according to the functional diagram.
5. Design 3D models of the components and body of the simulator prototype.
6. Prepare a 3D model of the simulator prototype body assembly for production on a 3D printer.

The need for such a simulator is that the navigation device itself, the magnetic compass KI-13, shows the magnetic heading only at the point at which it is installed, and since ground-based teaching devices simulate flights in different parts of the Earth, a real magnetic compass installed on them will be useless.

Technical characteristics:
1. The device should simulate the main methodological errors of the KI-13 compass.
2. Receive input data via Ethernet data transmission medium.
3. Calculation of errors in the microcontroller program code.
4. Flexibly adjust to the simulation of processes.
5. Have a body no more than 15 cm (a feature of the aerobatic stand).
6. Prepare design documentation for the device.
7. Prepare the prototype of the simulator body for the 3D printing process.
